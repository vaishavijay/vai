**Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday/Friday:** Khan Academy practice (30-60 min)

**Saturday:** review more videos online if needed + Khan Academy practice (30 min)

**Sunday:** Khan Academy practice (30-60 min)

Study Reflection For The Week - Looked over past test corrections for review for MCQs this week and completed tasks for this week

## Quiz Corrections: (Quiz 1: 38/50; Quiz 2: 40/50)

The following figure represents a network of physically linked devices labeled P through S. A line between two devices indicates a connection. Devices can communicate only through the connections shown. The figure presents a diagram of a network of physically linked devices labeled P through S. Device P is connected to devices Q, R, and S. Device Q is connected to devices P, R, and S. Device R is connected to devices P, Q and S. Device S is connected to devices P, Q, and R.Which of the following statements best explains the ability of the network to provide fault tolerance?
- A: A, not B (The network is considered fault-tolerant because it provides redundant routing. It cannot guarantee that components are foolproof)

ASCII is a character-encoding scheme that uses a numeric value to represent each character. For example, the uppercase letter “G” is represented by the decimal (base 10) value 71. A partial list of characters and their corresponding ASCII values are shown in the table below.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85912486/168683573-1d69ba8a-8409-4aa5-9c6c-94bfcfbe79c5.png)
ASCII characters can also be represented by hexadecimal numbers. According to ASCII character encoding, which of the following letters is represented by the hexadecimal (base 16) number 56?
- A: V, not L

An online store uses 6-bit binary sequences to identify each unique item for sale. The store plans to increase the number of items it sells and is considering using 7-bit binary sequences. Which of the following best describes the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6-bit sequences?
- A: A (Adding an extra binary digit allows for two times as many items to be identified, not 10 times as many.)

Which of the following is a characteristic of the fault-tolerant nature of routing on the Internet?
- A: The ability to provide data transmission even when some connections have failed (Routers on the Internet are able to move packets through various paths to reach their final destination, even when some connections have failed. This characterizes the fault-tolerant nature of routing.)

Which of the following best explains how data is typically assembled in packets for transmission over the Internet?
- A: Transmission over the interet requires the containment/transmission of data via routing, not decrypting.

Historically, it has been observed that computer processing speeds tend to double every two years. Which of the following best describes how technology companies can use this observation for planning purposes?
- A: Technology companies can set research and development goals based on anticipated processing speeds. (If it is assumed that computer processing speeds will double every two years, then companies can design new products with this assumption.)

The following procedure is intended to return the number of times the value val appears in the list myList. The procedure does not work as intended.Which of the following changes can be made so that the procedure will work as intended?
- A: Moving the statement in line 5 so that it appears between lines 2, not A 

A retailer that sells footwear maintains a single database containing records with the following information about each item for sale in the retailer’s store.

Item identification number

Footwear type (sneakers, boots, sandals, etc.)

Selling price (in dollars)

Size

Color

Quantity available

Using only the database, which of the following can be determined?
- A: A, not C (The database does not store information about the age of the people wearing the shoes.)

When a cellular telephone user places a call, the carrier transmits the caller’s voice as well as the voice of the person who is called. The encoded voices are the data of the call. In addition to transmitting the data, the carrier also stores metadata. The metadata of the call include information such as the time the call is placed and the phone numbers of both participants. For which of the following goals would it be more useful to computationally analyze the metadata instead of the data?To determine if a caller frequently uses a specific wordTo estimate the number of phone calls that will be placed next Monday between 10:30 A.M. and noon.To generate a list of criminal suspects when given the telephone number of a known criminal
- A: C, not B (Statement III is also correct because the metadata stores the phone numbers of the two parties of a call. Given one phone number, the metadata can be processed to provide all phone numbers that were called by or placed to that person.)

An Internet service provider (ISP) is considering an update to its servers that would save copies of the Web pages most frequently visited by each user.

Which of the following is LEAST likely to occur as a result of the update?Average response time for user requests might decrease.Privacy of users might be negatively affected.Storage requirements for the servers might increase.Web sites that are not visited frequently might no longer be accessible to users.
- A: D, not C (Storing several Web pages for every user of the ISP will take a significant amount of storage, since ISPs can serve thousands or millions of users.)
