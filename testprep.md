# Week 2: 5.5 - 5.6

## 5.5: Legal and Ethical Concerns

**Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.**

The GitHub license we chose was Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal. With CC0 license we waive copyright interest which means we canâ€™t make money of it. For users, using our code in Github is free(cost of free). By giving up copyright interest  we can make our project has a wider reach. If we choose other licenses, the user may not use our project because the cost is not free and will not share our project with their friends, family, co-worker, etc. This project we made is our first try, so the goal of this project is to gain more influence as we can, and to gain money is not necessarily our first goal. 

## 5.6: 

**Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.**

PII can be seen on my past projects's About Pages, which commonly list information about team members.

**What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?**

I believe my exposure is pretty secure. On my Social Media, for example, my things are all very secure as I have privacy settings enabled on them. As long as all people take precautions I believe it may not a bad thing.

**Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.**

Good passwords are descriptive and hard to guess, typically wordy and varying in capitalization, numbers, and special characters. Bad passwords are short and/or easy to guess. 2-step authentication through a phone or email can assist with further security in authentication.

**Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.**

Symmetric encryption uses a key to which the same key can be used to encript data, whereas in asymetric encryption, the emcription process is slower but more secure as there is more to its process.

**Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.**

In deployment, one may be asked for some kind of authorization or password, which would be more secure with asymetric encyption, though it may use both.

**Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.**

When I first got my email account in elementary school, I would be more intruiged to open spam emails which would use phishing tactics. Other phishing techniqyes enclude installing software, clicking attachments, whaling, and more.

# Week 1: 5.3 - 5.4

## 5.3 TPT: Computer Bias

**HP Computers Are Racist Discussion:**

The individual in the video believes this was intentional but I don't think it was intentional, but rather due to a general lack of diversity and representation when creating the machine algorithmn. Nonetheless, this is extremely harmful as training a computer model to regignize Eurocentric features more frequently than other POC facial traits. This should be corrected. To produce a better outcome to regignize a wide range of faces, the machine learning models should be trained with a diverse amount of faces even in various lightings to prevent this form of discrimination, wether intentional or unintentional, for good.

## 5.4 TPT: Crowdsourcing

**CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?**
A croudsource idea can be a public forum where AP students can post their past notes, discussions, resources, studying meathods, and more so eveyone can learn good study habits from eachother.

**What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?**

A croudsource idea can be a public forum where AP students can post their past notes, discussions, resources, studying meathods, and more so eveyone can learn good study habits from eachother. This is a potential idea for another project, but we could implement a similar public forum where students share ways they can better their mental health.

# Week 0: 5.1 - 5.2

### What can I do with Tech to improve mine or others education? 

I can use tech to hep organize resources to form positive concrete study habits, such as the Study Buddy website my team and I created last trimester for our PBL project.

## 5.1 TPT: Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing

**1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing**

Two advantages to computing are speed and accuracy in any procedure carried out by a program, piece of technology, etc, but this speed and accuracy depend highly on the procedures or processes used. If the procedure to carry out something is wrong, then the result will be wrong. This can be bad if you're using a procedure not knowing it was flawed and applying it to multiple parts of a program. This can also make technology very addicting as reward comes quicker, such as through video games, watching films, and social media. In addition, storage is much more efficient. However, this can be bad if data is not backed up somewhere such as an external drive, so lots of data have a risk of being lost, corrupted, or damaged.

**2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**

While there are many benefits to technology such as efficiency, speediness, and its ability being able to distract us from the waves of life, with this comes many negatives. Social media, video games, and other forms of quick consumable media are crafted by developers of apps and software designed to give users quick dopamine boosts such as instant content with a simple scroll, winning in games, etc. Thus, using technology instantly becomes very addicting which can distract students from school, which is extremely harmful in high school especially.

## 5.2 TPT: Digital Empowerment

**1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?**

Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by bringing awareness to areas where technology is not as prominent in the world (rural areas, no wifi, not enough resources, etc) to build and support others.

**2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**

Something someone who is empowered could do is help get any needed resources someone who is not empowered. At Del Norte HS, if someone does not have access to a personal device, for example, I could help them get a school chromebook and reccomend some places with free public wifi, depending on their needs and accessability. I could also help them get in contact with an adult in the school who can help them further with any assistance they may need.

**3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**

Red tape blocking is digital empowerment because it encourages privacy, security, and online saftey so it is safe for everyone.
