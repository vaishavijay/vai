Which of the following best explains the ability to solve problems algorithmically? A. Any problem can be solved algorithmically, though some algorithmic solutions may require humans to validate the results. B.Any problem can be solved algorithmically, though some algorithmic solutions must be executed on multiple devices in parallel. C.Any problem can be solved algorithmically, though some algorithmic solutions require a very large amount of data storage to execute. D.here exist some problems that cannot be solved algorithmically using any computer.
- A: D, not A (While some solutions benefit from being validated by a human, not all problems can be solved with an algorithm.)

Two computers are built by different manufacturers. One is running a Web server and the other is running a Web browser. Which of the following best describes the ability of the two computers to communicate with each other across the Internet? A. The computers cannot communicate because different manufacturers use different communication protocols. B. The computers can communicate, but additional hardware is needed to convert data packets from one computer’s protocol to the other computer’s protocol. C. The computers can communicate directly only if the messages consist of text; other formats cannot be interpreted across computers. D. The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.
- A: D, not B (The protocols of the Internet, including TCP/IP, allow any computers that run that protocol to send data back and forth to each other. Protocols such as TCP/IP are implemented through software, not hardware, and additional hardware is not required.)

A certain game keeps track of the maximum and minimum scores obtained so far. If num represents the most recent score obtained, which of the following algorithms correctly updates the values of the maximum and the minimum? AIf num is greater than the minimum, set the minimum equal to num. Otherwise, if num is greater than the maximum, set the maximum equal to num. BIf num is less than the minimum, set the minimum equal to num. Otherwise, if num is greater than the maximum, set the maximum equal to num. CIf num is less than the minimum, set the minimum equal to num. Otherwise, if num is less than the maximum, set the maximum equal to num. DIf num is greater than the minimum, set the minimum equal to num. Otherwise, if num is less than the maximum, set the maximum equal to num.
- A: B, not D (The minimum needs to be updated if the new number is less than the minimum, not greater. The second check is also incorrect. The maximum needs to be updated if the new number is greater than the maximum, not less)

A The procedure returns nothing because it will not terminate. B The procedure returns the value of 2 * n. C The procedure returns the value of n * n. D The procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.
- A: D, not C (The procedure does not return the value of n * n. For a procedure to return n * n, it could initialize result to 0 and then repeatedly add n to result a total of n times.)

The procedure below is intended to display the index in a list of unique names (nameList) where a particular name (targetName) is found. If targetName is not found in nameList, the code should display 0. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85912486/166509162-2d6777f7-889f-4951-8e7a-523ff8a2bb4c.png)
Which of the following procedure calls can be used to demonstrate that the procedure does NOT work as intended? A. FindName (["Andrea", "Ben"], "Ben"). B FindName (["Andrea", "Ben"], "Diane"). C FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris"], "Ben"). D FindName (["Andrea", "Chris", "Diane"], "Ben")
- A: C, not A (The procedure will display 2, which is the correct index for the targetName "Ben")

The procedure Smallest is intended to return the least value in the list numbers. The procedure does not work as intended.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85912486/166509299-4cd94548-3d35-4b2d-9a18-650f21d1b772.png) For which of the following values of One word, the List will Smallest, open parenthesis, one word, the List, close parenthesis NOT return the intended value?
- A: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85912486/166509373-0c1fdc86-496a-43a7-849f-f19c917af148.png) and ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85912486/166509397-839778fa-63eb-4fc9-95fa-edf56081eac4.png) (For the list [20, 10, 30, 40], 1 0 is the first value smaller than the first number in the list, so the procedure returns the correct value 10.

A social media site allows users to send messages to each other. A group of researchers gathered user data for the first 10 years of the site’s existence. Some of the data are summarized in the table below, along with some of the company milestones. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85912486/166509681-10a956fa-35c2-437d-a24b-072940ffdc97.png)Which of the following hypotheses is most consistent with the data in the table? A. The mobile app release did not have any effect on the average number of daily messages sent per user. B. The mobile app release discouraged new user registration on the site. C. The mobile app release led to users being less frequently active on the site.D. The mobile app release led to users tending to write shorter messages.
- A: D, not A (The average number of daily messages sent per user appears to increase after the mobile app was released)

A programmer is creating an algorithm that will be used to turn on the motor to open the gate in a parking garage. The specifications for the algorithm are as follows.The gate should not open when the time is outside of business hours.The motor should not turn on unless the gate sensor is activated.The motor should not turn on if the gate is already open. Which of the following algorithms can be used to open the gate under the appropriate conditions? ACheck if the time is outside of business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is closed. If it is, turn on the motor. BCheck if the time is during business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is open. If it is, turn on the motor. CCheck if the time is during business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is not, check if the gate is open. If it is not, turn on the motor.D Check if the time is during business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is open. If it is not, turn on the motor.
- A: D, not A (A's algorithm will turn on the motor in some cases when the time is outside business hours)

For which of the following situations would it be best to use a heuristic in order to find a solution that runs in a reasonable amount of time?A. Appending a value to a list of n elements, which requires no list elements be examined.B. Finding the fastest route that visits every location among n locations, which requires n! possible routes be examined.C. Performing a binary search for a score in a sorted list of n scores, which requires that fewer than n scores be examined.D. Performing a linear search for a name in an unsorted database of n people, which requires that up to n entries be examined.
- A: B, not C (This algorithm has linear efficiency, so it runs in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, a heuristic is not appropriate)

A homework assignment consists of 10 questions. The assignment is graded as follows. Let numCorrect represent the number of correct answers for a particular student. The following code segment is intended to display the appropriate grade based on numCorrect. The code segment does not work as intended in all cases.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85912486/166510189-b183ca0f-31b2-45c6-95b5-0ca2007891c0.png)For which of the following values of numCorrect does the code segment NOT display the intended grade?
- A: 8 and 6, not 9 (When numCorrect is 9, the condition numCorrect > 7 evaluates to true and the condition numCorrect ≥ 9 evaluates to true. Therefore "check plus" is displayed as intended)

A social media site allows users to send messages to each other. A group of researchers gathered user data for the first 10 years of the site’s existence. Some of the data are summarized in the table below, along with some of the company milestones.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85912486/166510368-1f658acf-6155-474a-823e-8b69654c359d.png)The researchers noticed that the total number of registered users appears to be increasing at about a constant rate. If this pattern continues, which of the following best approximates the total number of registered users, in millions, in year 12 (two years after the last entry in the table) ?
- A: 31.2, not 31.8 (The approximation 31.8 million would be a better estimate for year 13)

n public key cryptography, the sender uses the recipient’s public key to encrypt a message. Which of the following is needed to decrypt the message?
- A: recipient's private key is needed to decrypt the message, not the public one (public cannot be used)

A store uses binary numbers to assign a unique binary sequence to each item in its inventory. What is the minimum number of bits required for each binary sequence if the store has between 75 and 100 items in its inventory?
- A: 7, not 6 (Using 6 bits will only allow for up to 64 sequences because 26=64)

Which of the following is an example of symmetric encryption?A. Evy buys a locked box that operates using two different codes. When the first code is entered, a slot opens that allows a message to be put in the box. When the second code is entered, the door to the box opens. Evy gives the first code to her friends so they can leave messages for her and keeps the second code to herself so that she is the only one who can retrieve the messages. B. Finn and Gwen develop a system that maps each letter of the alphabet to a unique symbol using a secret key. Finn uses the key to write a message to Gwen where each letter is replaced with the corresponding symbol. Gwen uses the key to map each symbol back to the original letter. C. Hannah writes a message to send to Isabel and hides the message under a rock behind the soccer field. Hannah gives Isabel the exact location of the rock so that only Isabel can find the message. D. Juan writes a message to send to Kelly and slides the message through a slot in the front of Kelly’s locker. Juan knows that Kelly has not shared her locker combination with anyone, so no one other than Kelly will be able to read the message.
- A: B, not D (This is an example of an asymmetric system because only Kelly knows the key used to receive messages)

In a certain game, the integer variable bonus is assigned a value based on the value of the integer variable score.
* If score is greater than 100, bonus is assigned a value that is 10 times score.
* If score is between 50 and 100 inclusive, bonus is assigned the value of score.
* If score is less than 50, bonus is assigned a value of 0.
Which of the following code segments assigns bonus correctly for all possible integer values of score ? Select two answers.
- A: D, not C (This code segment incorrectly sets bonus to score when score > 100)

A basic StreamPal account is free, but it displays advertisements that are based on data collected by the application. For example, if a user listens to a particular artist, the application may display an advertisement for concert tickets the next time the artist comes to the user’s city. Users have the ability to pay a monthly fee for a premium account, which removes advertisements from the application. Which of the following is most likely to be a data privacy concern for StreamPal users? A. Users of the application are required to rate songs in order to enable all of the application’s features. B. Users of the application may have the ability to determine information about the locations of users that are not on their contact list. C. Users of the application may not be able to use the application if they are located in an area with a poor Internet connection. D. Users of the application may not have similar music taste to any other users on their contact list.
- A: B, not C (Requiring users to have a reliable Internet connection is not considered a privacy concern)
