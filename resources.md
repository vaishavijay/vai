## Create Task Guidelines

**Instructions For Input:**

* the User is going to be inputting functions to calculate by pressing buttons that correspond with certain numbers or calculative functions (i.e addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

**Use of at least one list (or another collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program’s purpose**

* Calculations will be stored in an array

**At least one procedure that contributes to the program’s intended purpose, where you have defined: the procedure’s name, the return type (if necessary), one or more parameters, etc.**

* The procedure will take in user input and calculate integers. If a user is going to be typing in multiple numbers at a time, the procedure backs up each number into the form of a string so that the numbers don't add up to one another. This will allow the user to calculate larger numbers.

**An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure**

* It will use sequencing in the procedure since each piece of code happens one after another

**Calls To Your Student-Developed Procedure**

* will be a student-developed procedure that saves answers for calculation as a variable and by using arrays and multiple variables, the program will display the answers of the last 6 calculations the user makes

**Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and program functionality**

* Calculations will be displayed on the screen per calculation the user makes (visual output aka calculations that the user initiates)
